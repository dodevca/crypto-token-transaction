# Crypto Token Transaction

## About This Project

Crypto Token Transaction is a simple Web3-based decentralized application (dApp) that demonstrates how to perform a basic token transaction on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network. Users can connect their crypto wallet, check their ETH balance, and purchase tokens using BNB via an intuitive HTML + JS interface. This project uses `web3.js` for blockchain interaction and integrates `WalletConnect` to support both desktop and mobile wallets.
